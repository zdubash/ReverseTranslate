## Welcome to lost-in-translation.

Lost In Translation is an Olin College Software Design Final Project created by Zarius and Annie.

### The Big Idea

As we both have an interest in languages, and language translation, we felt this game would be the perfect project for us to finish this course. 

We started by creating a program that would compare various language services available (like Google, Bing, etc), and show how various services can translate English phrases differently.  After a bit of thinking, we decided to make this translation service more of a game, because we saw how many phrases were mistranslated when reversed back into English.

We thought it would be interesting to create a chain, and run the same phrase through multiple languages and then finally back into English.

Our project underwent a transformation from a basic translation and comparison service to more of a “Telephone” game, showing how various words within phrases can get swapped out with more commonly used synonyms and therefore, how various phrases can unintentionally have different meanings.

### Usage

After installing dependencies, as linked in the [README](https://github.com/zdubash/lost-in-translation/blob/main/README.md), download both `lost-in-translation.py` and `helpers.py` from the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/zdubash/lost-in-translation/tree/main) and then run the main file with `python lost-in-translation.py`.

Input any phrase, choose the various languages you’d like to use to translate it (one at a time), and watch how some of the words or the meaning may change as it reverts back to English at the end.

### Unique Features

We think one of the best parts about our project is the way we show how words in various languages can get translated to more commonly used synonyms, and alter the meaning of the sentence.

We also think we can bring some laughter and joy to those who use it because it is reminiscent of a childhood game, called “telephone”, except with multiple languages involved.

### About Us

Zarius and Annie are students at Babson College, graduating in December 2020. We have enjoyed our time cross-registering at Olin College throughout the past 2 years.

This course is the final step in completing each of our Olin College Engineering Certificates with concentrations in the field of Design.

### Special Thanks

We give thanks to Steve and the NINJA team for their help with this project as well as the entire course. 

We also extend gratitude to the authors of [translators](https://pypi.org/project/translators/) and [translate](https://pypi.org/project/translate/), whose libraries are a key component of our project and were instrumental to our success.
