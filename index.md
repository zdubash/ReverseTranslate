### The Big Idea

As we both have an interest in languages, and language translation, we felt this game would be the perfect project for us to finish this course. 

We started by creating a program that would compare various language services available (like Google, Bing, etc), and show how various services can translate English phrases differently.  After a bit of thinking, we decided to make this translation service more of a game, because we saw how many phrases were mistranslated when reversed back into English.

We thought it would be interesting to create a chain, and run the same phrase through multiple languages and then finally back into English.

Our project underwent a transformation from a basic translation and comparison service to more of a “Telephone” game, showing how various words within phrases can get swapped out with more commonly used synonyms and therefore, how various phrases can unintentionally have different meanings.

### Usage

After installing dependencies, as linked in the [README](https://github.com/zdubash/lost-in-translation/blob/main/README.md), 
Input any phrase, choose the various languages you’d like to use to translate it, and watch how some of the words or the meaning may change as it reverts back to English at the end.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/zdubash/lost-in-translation/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
